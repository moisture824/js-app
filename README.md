Sample Pokemon Application

Objective: To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

Content Learned:

- Implementing Javascript
- Loaded data from an API
- How to add UI elements with Javascript
- Introduction to jQuery
- Utilized Bootstrap for streamling css styling
- Debugging code using ESL linting & chrome web dev functions

Some Lessons Learned:

- Always aim for the 'Rule of Least Power' (i.e., always use the least powerful language possible to save space & allows for as much accessibility for all users)
- Javascript will sometimes not work due to internet, browser, cache, issues etc. which is out of your control. What the developer can control is minimizing the risk of these issues arising.
- Both jQuery & Bootstrap can save a developer a lot of time when utilized properly. However, both takes up a lot of space, try to avoid whenever possible.
